For PR's, follow Spout guidelines:

Coding and Pull Request Formatting
----------------------------------
* Generally follow the Oracle coding standards.
* Use tabs, no spaces.
* No trailing whitespaces.
* 200 column limit for readability.
* Pull requests must compile, work, and be formatted properly.
* Sign-off on ALL your commits - this indicates you agree to the terms of our license.
* No merges should be included in pull requests unless the pull request's purpose is a merge.
* Number of commits in a pull request should be kept to *one commit* and all additional commits must be *squashed*.
* You may have more than one commit in a pull request if the commits are separate changes, otherwise squash them.
* For clarification, see the full pull request guidelines [here](http://spout.in/prguide).

**Please follow the above conventions if you want your pull request(s) accepted.**
